# BookLearning

I like to read and collect information about the books I'm reading to try and find patterns which will make it easier 
for me to find books I like in the future. This repository uses a google sheet containing all the information about
the books I have read and am currently reading, and another CSV file containing goodreads reviews prior to 2017.
